## Getting Started

This is the facilities app. Youll need an internet connection to access the backend api that's hosted on a cloudlare worker. Follow the steps below to get it working. (I built it on Mac so there may be tiny differences for other platforms.)

First clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-krafty-koder/facilities.git
```

Navigate into the repo and navigate into the frontend app

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/facilities" to use the app.
